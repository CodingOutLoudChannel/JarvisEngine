# JarvisEngine

This script was run on Mac Catalina OS.

It's just plug and play, no other script is required.

You will need to import certain libraries if they are not already present(e.g. Selenium Driver, python's speech_recognition, and google gTTS)

Google the errors you get on execution of the script and import the required libraries using pip install *your library* command
